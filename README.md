A simple python backend program that allows you interact with a cinema based application through your terminal

You will need to have MYSQL running at all times which you can do with xampp or zampp(Either one of your choosing)

I made an update being that now your data is more protected in the sense that whenever you input your password it won't be sent directly to the database like that it will be hashed so even i wouldn't have access to your data and it will only be unhashed when validation is to take place

Constructive criticisms are welcome and appreciated👍:)
